# az-ubuntu-vm

This code is from working through the [Getting Started with Terraform on Azure: Deploying Resources](https://cloudskills.io/blog/terraform-azure-01) blog over at CloudSkills.io.

I have updated the code to include associating the NSG to the subnet and added an output to show the public IP address.
